<main>
<p>Around summer of 2020, a former coworker either heard or made up a
devastating rumor about me. For almost two years, I was targeted and abused by
peers and supervisors where we worked.</p>
<p>It was harrowing, yet preposterous. Picture a cross between a dark <em>60 Minutes</em>
episode and middle school bullying.</p>
<p>It was impossible for me to understand what was happening. Long after I knew
that something was terribly wrong, I still had no idea what. It was every bit as
bizarre and confusing for me as it would’ve been for anyone else.</p>
<p>In March, very suddenly, at least two of the coworkers involved—both practically
VPs—lost their jobs over what had happened. I was given paid leave while the
company “investigated.” Eventually, I was told I could stay, but also offered a
modest severance payment, which I took.</p>
<p>To this day, everything about what happened has been kept secret from me. I have
no idea what my coworkers believed or how it started. Very likely, they were
tricked into harassing me on behalf of someone else.</p>
<p>When they realized their mistake, every single person involved—and there were
many—simply pretended that nothing had happened. They’re determined to never
admit their role, even if that means protecting someone who caused it all on
purpose.</p>
<p>They had reason to hope I’d never catch on: even as I left in March, I was
terribly confused. By then, I was well aware that I’d been harassed, and it was
sinking in that something very strange had happened. But I still couldn’t make
any sense of it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve never been suspected of practically any offense in my life. My record is
spotless. I have no secrets, dark or otherwise. There’s nothing about my life
that I wouldn’t have discussed openly with friends at work. <em>Nothing</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the response was too bizarre—too blatantly illegitimate—to be a
mistake. Law enforcement was never involved. It was shockingly childish and
sadistic. Most telling, perhaps, it went on for <em>nearly two years</em>, despite the
complete absence of evidence.</p>
<p>To me, the only plausible explanation is that I was targeted. Someone told my
former coworkers a damaging lie about me as a vicious form of harassment.</p>
<p>Consider the relationship between a company and the person who tricked it into
carrying out a laughably transparent harassment scheme. Who has the power?</p>
<p>Everything that happened is <em>far</em> more damaging to the company than to the
harasser. Every incentive the company has compels it to protect the harasser and
hide the truth—at the very least.</p>
<hr />
<p>Picture me keeping quiet about this, without any kind of resolution. Doing so
puts me and the people around me in danger. That’s no hyperbole: what happened
at that office was dangerous, full stop.</p>
<p>Whatever this is, it thrived on secrecy. Secret’s out. Until it’s resolved,
there will be only exposure. Until I know how this started; until I know how to
make sure it never happens again; and until I’m positive that nobody benefited
monetarily; I will never, ever go away. I will be relentless.</p>
<p>One last thing: to anyone who ever believed in me, or who wouldn’t have wanted a
terrible rumor about me to be true: <strong>thank you</strong>. It means the world to me.</p>
